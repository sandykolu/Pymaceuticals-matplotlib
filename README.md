Observations/Inferences:
Comparing the box plots of Capomulin treatment regimen with Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin, it appears that Capomulin treatment is better than Infubinol, and Ceftamin and slightly underperforms compared to Ramicane

The variability for Capomulin treatment regimen is lesser compared to that of Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin since the IQR's for them are bigger than Capomulin. This indicates that Capomulin regimen treatment is more reliable than the others.

The box plot for Capomulin treatment regimen indicates that that the data is leftskewed. That means the tumor volumes of the tumors greater than the median are closer together than the tumor volumes of tumors lesser than the median.

There are no outliers for the Capomulin treatment regimen for this data set.

The Correlation coefficient between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen is 0.84. This indicates that there is a strong correlation as (r >=0.7 )

A randomly selected mouse g316 who was on the Capomulin treatment regimen showed approx 11% reduction in tumor after 45 day course was completed
